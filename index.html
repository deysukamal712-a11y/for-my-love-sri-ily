{bg:"#020617", text:`Hey.<br><br>This is me slowing down, because you’re not something I rush through. You never were.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#0f172a", text:`I wanted to say things properly. Not loudly. Not dramatically. Just honestly.`, btns:["Go on"]},
{bg:"#1e293b", text:`Before anything else — are you here with me?`, btns:["Yes","I’m listening"]},
{bg:"#020617", text:`Good. Because what follows isn’t casual. It’s intentional.`, btns:["Okay"]},

{bg:"#111827", text:`Love, for me, isn’t excitement that fades. It’s presence that stays. It’s choosing the same person even when nobody is watching.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#1f2937", text:`I don’t love you in fragments. I love you as a whole — including the parts you hide when you think you’re too much.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#020617", text:`When I think about the future, I don’t imagine perfection. I imagine stability. I imagine peace. I imagine effort that doesn’t need reminders.`, btns:["Go on"]},

{bg:"#0b132b", text:`Quick pause.`, btns:["Okay"]},
{bg:"#312e81", text:`Do you believe love should feel safe?`, btns:["Yes","I think so"]},
{bg:"#020617", text:`Because safety was always my intention with you.`, btns:["Continue"]},

{bg:"#111827", text:`I’m working hard. Quietly. Not to impress the world — but to become someone who can protect what we build together.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#1f2937", text:`You deserve consistency. You deserve effort that doesn’t disappear when things get uncomfortable.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#020617", text:`Love, to me, is patience on tired days and reassurance without being asked. And somehow, you made me want to be better at that.`, btns:["Go on"]},

{bg:"#0f172a", text:`Another honest question.`, btns:["Ask"]},
{bg:"#020617", text:`Do you feel understood here?`, btns:["Yes","I’m starting to"]},
{bg:"#1e293b", text:`That matters more to me than you know.`, btns:["Continue"]},

{bg:"#020617", text:`Love isn’t poetry because it sounds pretty. Love becomes poetry when it stays, when it sacrifices, when it chooses growth over ego.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#111827", text:`And when I describe love honestly — stripped of metaphors — I always end up describing you.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#1f2937", text:`You’re not a chapter. You’re the reason the story slows down and becomes intentional.`, btns:["Go on"]},

{bg:"#020617", text:`If the world ever convinces you that you’re too much, remember this: depth was never meant for shallow hands.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#0b132b", text:`Tell me something.`, btns:["What?"]},
{bg:"#312e81", text:`Do you feel safe being yourself here?`, btns:["Yes","I do now"]},

{bg:"#020617", text:`Good. Because that’s the foundation of everything I want with you.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#111827", text:`I don’t promise perfection. I promise accountability. I promise effort. I promise not leaving when things get real.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#1f2937", text:`Love isn’t fireworks every day. Most days, it’s quiet consistency. And I want to give you the kind that lasts.`, btns:["Go on"]},

{bg:"#020617", text:`Another pause.`, btns:["Okay"]},
{bg:"#0f172a", text:`If love were a definition, it wouldn’t be excitement. It would be trust. It would be choosing one person over and over — and for me, that person is you.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#020617", text:`I don’t want to rush time. I want to build something that survives it.`, btns:["Continue"]},

{bg:"#111827", text:`You deserve someone who doesn’t just want you — but plans for you.`, btns:["Continue"]},
{bg:"#1f2937", text:`And I am planning. Quietly. Seriously. Intentionally.`, btns:["Go on"]},

{bg:"#020617", text:`So let me stop circling around this and ask you clearly.`, btns:["Okay"]},

{bg:"#0b132b", text:`Will you be my Valentine?<br><br>Not just for a day — but for the effort, the growth, the patience, and the future I’m choosing with you.`, btns:["Yes ❤️","Of course"]},

{bg:"#000000", text:`Thank you for saying yes — to this moment, to this intention, and to something real.`, btns:["❤️"]},

{bg:"#000000", text:`This isn’t the end. This is the beginning I wanted to be honest about.`, btns:["Finish"]}
